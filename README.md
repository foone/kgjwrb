Ken Griffey Jr's. Winning Run Baseball player roster extractor

This is a tool that takes a ROM (not included) of the Super Nintendo game Ken Griffey Jr's. Winning Run Baseball and dumps the player roster, both regular and pitching.

It is very much a work in progress but should correctly extract all players at this point. 

I intend to switch it to a more normal format (such as JSON), and make it bidirectional (adding import as well).

## TO USE:
1. Get a rom for Ken Griffey Jr's. Winning Run Baseball by entirely legitimate means.
2. name it "Ken Griffey Jr's. Winning Run Baseball (U).smc" exactly, and put it in the same folder as players.py
3. Run players.py with python2.7.
